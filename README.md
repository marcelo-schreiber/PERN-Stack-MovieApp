# PERN-Stack-MovieApp
A generic movie app using PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, ReactJs, Node.js) - RestAPI. This is my first fullstack website, hope someone likes it.

A example is hosted in https://pern-generic-movie-app.herokuapp.com/

And the restAPI is in https://pern-generic-movie-app.herokuapp.com/movies

# How to run on your machine

- Make sure to download nodejs and postgreSQL.

- Create a database in your postgreSQL terminal and
a .env file in the root directory with the content


### PG_USER=your_user
### PG_PASSWORD=password
### PG_HOST=host
### PG_PORT=port
### PG_DATABASE=name_of_database


- Install dependencies using:

### `npm install`

- now, in throot directory run:

### `node index`

- and in the frontend folder use:

### npm start

- Your machine should be hosting an example in your localhost in port 3000.
